/**
 * This class will be used to model a tree of Moves.
 * <p>
 * The branches of the tree represent variations, or moves undone. The
 * tree may have any number of leaves at each node. Tree traversal is
 * not included as a method. The order of the nodes is based entirely on
 * order of entry since there is no sensible way to sort Moves.
 * <p>
 * <p>Setup nodes occur within the tree and any Move related information stored
 * in a node containing setup information should be ignored. Setup nodes
 * should not add to the MoveNum variable as a setup does not constitute a
 * Move. Setups in the middle of the tree are allowed in order to support
 * the SGF file format.
 * <p>
 * <p><b><i>This class is due for a refactoring</i></b>, it does too much. It
 * should be devided into a MoveNode, a SetupNode and a RootNode which inherit
 * from an AbstractNode. This will also bring the object model in closer
 * corespondence with the structure of an SGF file.
 * <p>
 * <p>There will also be a need to write a GameInfo class and provide a place
 * to attach it to the first distinguishing move in a tree of games begining
 * with the move sequence. This will not be necessary until either loading of
 * ANY SGF file is supported, or creation of multi-game trees is supported.
 * <p>
 * <p> It is important to note that while some methods here will work for
 * board sizes over or under 19x19 <b>only 19x19 is fully supported</b> by all
 * the methods in this class at this time. Some Functionality may need to be
 * swaped out to other classes (particularly in the realm of generating
 * SGF output) to support other board sizes.
