/**
 * This class will record a single position on a go board.
 * <p>
 * <p>A record of all positions must be kept in order to implement the AGA's
 * Super-Ko rule, which disallows exact repetition of ANY board position.
 * There is no way to uniquely represent a position on a go board in a
 * 32 bit hashCode(). In fact, that is too few bits by a factor of almost
 * 20.
 * <p>
 * <p>We will use an array of int to represent a board position for
 * each color. This representation was chosen as a compromise between
 * implementation ease and memory usage as follows:
 * <p>
 * <p>This gives us 2 arrays of 76 bytes usage per position,
 * and in a typical game there are less 300 moves. Therefore a typical
 * vector containing all positions in the game will occupy a very
 * reasonable 45k or so. Since there are 1.74e178 possible board positions
 * the smallest possible representation would be 9 longs and an int (593
 * bits are needed). Representing the positions as a character array would
 * bring the cost of a 300 move game to over 216 Kilobytes, since each point
 * on the board would then cost 16 bits. Though most computers today have much
 * more ram than this, this code was written in a time when that still was
 * a lot of memory.
 * <p>
 * <p>The dual array of 19 ints assumes empty if a bit is not on in either
 * array, (using only the 19 least significant bits). The condition of both
 * bits being on is an error. A bit on in one array indicates a black stone
 * at that position, and a bit on in the other array indicates a white stone
 * at that position. The combination of the 2 arrays to represent a board is
 * not hard to fathom (for me at least) and turning bits on and off is fairly
 * easy. This also makes error checks and queries based on boolean operations.
 * (requiring a bit of logic thinking but not too hard)
 * <p>
 * <p>The 19 int or 9 long/1 int method essentially would rely on a base 3
 * representation of the board 0 for empty, 1 for white and 2 for black.
 * Black, white or empty must be known for all 361 positions, to uniquely
 * represent the board, therefore a 593 bit (= 3.24e178) representation
 * is the minimum possible without finding a way to skip positions that are
 * illegal. I doubt the CPU costs of such a task would be reasonable! Also
 * keep in mind that pass is a legal move, so if both players were terminally
 * stupid, or trying to break the program, the board could fill with stones
 * of a single color (for example).
 * <p>
 * <p>Converting to a 361 digit base 3 number makes my brain hurt. It hardly
 * seems worth the effort for a measly 20k of ram or so. Even palmtops have
 * at least a 2 Megabytes (and frequently 8) these days!.
 * <p>
 * <p>Positions other than an empty board should be built from other positions.
 * this class does not attempt to do any rules checking, so checking for self
 * capture, ko and a stone already there. This lack of checking enables the
 * use of this class for positions on 19x19 13x13 or 9x9 since those will
 * effectively just be a subsection of the 19x19 board. Support for over sized
 * boards up to 57x57 could be added by converting this to an array of long
 * and increasing the size of the vectors.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>FIXME: This class probably should be immutable but is not.
 * <p>TODO: Recode this with array of char (or byte) and compare speed. Another
 * possibility is using java1.4 ByteBuffers which would be more flexable for
 * oversized boards, but harder to code.
 * <p>TODO: This class currently is one of the key limmitations preventing
 * alternate board sizes. The magic number in colmasks, posBlack and posWhite
 * need to be abstracted.
