 * values in the markup fields differ. This is subject to change however, so
 * storing Positions and MarkablePositions mixed in the same utility class is
 * strongly reccomended against.

   * members of a group and thus stones diagonal to a member stone are
   * not counted as members of the same group unless they share an ajacent
   * stone. This is a universal minimal standard in all forms of Go, and
   * can thus be safely encoded here.
